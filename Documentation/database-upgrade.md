### How
1. Add a **Status** field (single select: “Pending,” “Paid,” “Shipped,” “Delivered”) in the **Orders Table**.
2. Create automations:
   - **Trigger**: When the `Payment Method` changes to “Paid.”
   - **Action**: Update the `Status` field to “Paid.”
3. Another automation:
   - **Trigger**: When the `Type` field changes to “shipping” or “delivery.”
   - **Action**: Update the `Status` field to “Shipped” or “Out for Delivery.”

## 4. Validate Address Fields

### Why
Ensure all necessary address details are captured for accurate delivery or shipping.

### How
1. Add an **Address Validation** field in the **Orders Table** (formula):
   ```plaintext
   IF(
     {address} = "",
     "Missing Address",
     "Valid Address"
   )
   ```
2. Create a filtered view to display orders with missing or invalid addresses.

## 5. Optimize Views for Order Management

### Why
Simplify tracking of pending, paid, and completed orders.

### How
1. Create views in the **Orders Table**:
   - **Pending Orders**: Filter where `Status` = "Pending."
   - **Paid Orders**: Filter where `Status` = "Paid."
   - **Shipped/Delivered Orders**: Filter where `Status` = "Shipped" or "Delivered."
2. Add grouping by `Type` (delivery vs. shipping) for better segmentation.

# Airtable E-commerce Enhancements

This documentation reflects the updated Airtable table structure, focusing on **delivery fees**, **shipping fees**, and the integration of these features into the **Orders** table.

## 1. Automate Delivery and Shipping Fee Calculations

### Why
Automatically calculate delivery and shipping fees based on the `Type` field (delivery or shipping), `Total` field, and `Borough` field.

### How
1. **Settings Table**:
   - Use the `delivery_fee` field to store the fixed delivery fee amount for each borough.
   - Use the `minimum_order` field to store the threshold for free delivery for each borough.
   - Add a `Borough` field to specify the boroughs (e.g., Manhattan, Brooklyn, etc.) and their associated fees.

2. **Orders Table**:
   - Link the **Orders Table** to the **Settings Table** via a `Borough` field.
   - Add a **Delivery Fee** field (formula):
     ```plaintext
     IF(
       AND({Type} = "delivery", {Total} < LOOKUP({Settings::minimum_order}, {Borough} = {Orders::Borough})),
       LOOKUP({Settings::delivery_fee}, {Borough} = {Orders::Borough}),
       0
     )
     ```
   - This ensures the delivery fee is calculated dynamically based on the order’s borough and total value.

## 2. Use an Order Details Table for Line-Item Breakdown

### Why
Enable detailed tracking of individual items within an order, including quantity and pricing.

### How
1. **Order Details Table**:
   - Fields: `Order ID` (linked to Orders), `Item Name`, `Quantity`, `Price`, `Subtotal` (formula: `Quantity * Price`).

2. **Orders Table**:
   - Replace the `Items` field with a linked field to **Order Details**.
   - Roll up the subtotal of all linked `Order Details` to calculate the total value of items.

## 3. Automate Order Status Updates

### Why
Streamline the process of updating order statuses as payments are received and orders are shipped or delivered.

### How
1. Add a **Status** field (single select: “Pending,” “Paid,” “Shipped,” “Delivered”) in the **Orders Table**.
2. Create automations:
   - **Trigger**: When the `Payment Method` changes to “Paid.”
   - **Action**: Update the `Status` field to “Paid.”
3. Another automation:
   - **Trigger**: When the `Type` field changes to “shipping” or “delivery.”
   - **Action**: Update the `Status` field to “Shipped” or “Out for Delivery.”

## 6. Dashboard for Order and Fee Management

### Why
Centralize order and fee management with Airtable Interface Designer.

### How
1. Build a **Grid Interface**:
   - Include widgets for `delivery_fee`, `shipping_fee`, `minimum_order`, and `minimum_order_for_free_shipping` values from the **Settings Table**.
   - Show linked records from **Orders** for quick reference to fees and totals.
2. Add buttons for team members to update statuses directly from the interface.

---

## 7. Best Practices

### Maintain Single Sources of Truth
Use the **Settings Table** to manage all delivery and shipping fee configurations in one place.

### Test Formula Accuracy
Run tests to confirm the `Delivery/Shipping Fee` formulas work correctly for various order scenarios.

### Automate Updates
Use Airtable Automations to trigger updates for orders or notify team members about key changes.

### Integrate with Site
Ensure your website fetches fee and order data directly from Airtable’s API for real-time accuracy.

By implementing these enhancements, your Airtable database will dynamically handle delivery and shipping fees, track individual order details, and streamline order management for your team.
