---

## **2. System Architecture**

**Overview**  
The platform is divided into three primary components:

1. **Customer Portal**  
   - User-facing frontend for browsing and purchasing products.  
2. **Admin Panel**  
   - Admin interface for managing products, orders, rewards, and other backend configurations.  
3. **Backend Services**  
   - APIs and business logic to handle data operations, integrations, and security concerns.

**Technology Stack**

- **Frontend**  
  - **Framework**: React.js (TypeScript recommended for maintainability)  
  - **Design System**: TailwindCSS + ShadCN components  
  - **Hosting**: Vercel or Netlify for continuous deployment

- **Backend**  
  - **Framework**: Node.js with Express.js  
  - **API Pattern**: RESTful services (consider GraphQL if complex queries are needed)  
  - **Hosting**: AWS Lambda or Firebase Functions (serverless architecture)

- **Authentication**  
  - **Firebase Authentication** (planned) for secure user and admin login

- **Database**  
  - **Primary**: Airtable (current setup)  
  - **Future Consideration**: PostgreSQL for scalability and complex relational queries

- **Other Integrations**  
  - **ShipStation** (planned) for shipping management and label generation  
  - **Firebase Cloud Messaging** (planned) for real-time notifications

## **3. Technical Requirements**

### **3.1 Frontend Requirements**

1. **Responsive Design**  
   - Must function seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.  
   - Implement a mobile-first approach.

2. **Componentization**  
   - Use ShadCN principles for reusable and consistent UI components.  
   - Maintain a clear hierarchy (atomic design or similar).

3. **Performance**  
   - Aim for initial page load under **2 seconds** on average hardware.  
   - Use **lazy loading** for images and non-critical scripts.

---

### **3.2 Backend Requirements**

1. **Scalability**  
   - Handle **up to 500 concurrent requests** without significant performance degradation.  
   - Design endpoints to scale horizontally on AWS Lambda or Firebase Functions.

2. **Error Handling**  
   - Implement standardized JSON error responses (e.g., `{ error: "...", code: 400 }`).  
   - Use monitoring services (Sentry, Firebase Crashlytics) for error tracking.

3. **Security**  
   - All API endpoints must be served over **HTTPS**.  
   - Apply input validation and sanitize data to prevent SQL injection or XSS.  
   - Implement rate limiting on public endpoints.

---

### **3.3 Authentication Requirements**

1. **Phone-Based Login**  
   - Use **Firebase Authentication** for secure OTP-based sign-in.  
   - Store minimal user data to comply with privacy regulations.

2. **Session Management**  
   - Tokens (JWT or Firebase tokens) expire after **30 minutes** of inactivity.  
   - Refresh tokens should be securely stored and handled.

---

### **3.4 Database Requirements**

1. **Data Structure**  
   - Separate tables (or bases in Airtable) for `products`, `orders`, `users`, and `rewards`.  
   - Minimize redundancy by normalizing data where possible.

2. **Backups**  
   - **Automated backups** at least every 24 hours.  
   - Retain backups for a specified retention period (e.g., 7–30 days).

---

### **3.5 Integration Requirements**

1. **ShipStation Integration (Planned)**  
   - Sync orders for shipping label generation.  
   - Implement **retry logic** for API failures or network issues.

2. **Notifications**  
   - **Firebase Cloud Messaging (Planned)** for order updates and reward notifications.  
   - Provide opt-in/out options for SMS or email alerts.

---

## **4. Deployment and DevOps**

### **4.1 Hosting and Deployment**

1. **Frontend**  
   - Deploy on **Vercel** or **Netlify** for streamlined CI/CD.  
   - Configure environment variables securely (API keys, etc.).

2. **Backend**  
   - Deploy using **AWS Lambda** or **Firebase Functions** for a serverless approach.  
   - Use Infrastructure as Code (e.g., AWS SAM or Terraform) for repeatable deployments.

---

### **4.2 CI/CD Pipelines**

1. **Automated Testing**  
   - Run unit and integration tests on each commit or pull request via GitHub Actions (or similar).  
   - Block merges if tests fail or coverage is below an agreed threshold.

2. **Staging Environment**  
   - Deploy to a **staging** environment for QA and user acceptance testing.  
   - On approval, promote to **production** environment.

---

### **4.3 Monitoring and Logging**

1. **Real-Time Monitoring**  
   - Use **Firebase Monitoring** or a similar service for real-time metrics on function execution.  
   - Track response times, errors, and throughput.

2. **Logging**  
   - Implement centralized logging with **Sentry**, **LogDNA**, or **Datadog**.  
   - Retain logs for a minimum of 30 days for troubleshooting and audits.

---

## **5. Security Considerations**

1. **Authentication**  
   - Enforce **2FA** (two-factor authentication) for all admin accounts.  
   - Use industry-standard hashing (e.g., bcrypt) for passwords if stored.

2. **API Security**  
   - Require API keys or JWT tokens for all critical endpoints.  
   - Enable **rate limiting** to prevent brute-force attacks.

3. **Data Privacy**  
   - Adhere to **GDPR**, **CCPA**, and other relevant data protection regulations.  
   - Use encryption at rest for sensitive data (e.g., customer information).

---

## **6. Future Enhancements**

1. **Database Migration**  
   - Transition to **PostgreSQL** (or equivalent) for complex relational queries and improved performance.  
   - Consider a structured migration strategy (e.g., use a migration tool or phased approach).

2. **AI-Driven Recommendations**  
   - Integrate a recommendation engine (e.g., collaborative filtering or content-based) for personalized product suggestions.

3. **Multi-Tenancy**  
   - Expand functionality to support multiple stores or franchised locations under a single platform instance.
